Logging on their is the main hub, from this you can chose a series of games

Multiplayer home

So far there is only one multiplayer game, but that I hope will change, the home page has a check connection stage, the connecting of the devices is similar throughout all multiplayer games so here is the run down.

Connection process
Client hit connect button, this searches for connection
Surver hits list picker and choses client. 
Wait for prompted
Repeat until find prompt (usually works after 1 or 2 tries)

Hangman

You know it, you love it, the client has to enter a 4 to 6 letter word that is sent to the other player, as the player receives the word they get a prompt, then they guess the letters one at a time which appears in place until correct or has run out of guesses.

Client input
6 text box- enters a letter or _ 
Send button- sends the content of the 6 labels

Sever input
1 text box- contains what the user wants to guess
Send button- guesses what is in the text box
6 labels- shows the correct guesses and the placements
